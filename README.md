Shapes Juke
====

Shapes Juke is an action game, which I made years ago. Players just move crosshair with arrow keys not to touch red shapes...

I just uploaded this repository slept in my backup USB after removing files with issues regarding of copyrights such as music.
So if you say you want to build this, I just say good luck...
